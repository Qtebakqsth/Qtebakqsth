Hi, I’m @Qtebakqsth
I’m interested in electronics, radio & aviation

My long term projects:
- 6M/10M dual band radio transciever (+amateur radio license) 

   `-> Using CV4503 pentode Valves as amplifiers. Valves are way cooler than silicon.
  
- DCS Simpit (slowly)

    `-> This will be based on the L39C/ZA
